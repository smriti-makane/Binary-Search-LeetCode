278. First Bad Version
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

Example 1:
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int start = 1, end = n;
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                end = mid; 
            } else {
                start = mid + 1; 
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
}
