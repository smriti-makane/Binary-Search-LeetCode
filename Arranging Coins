441. Arranging Coins
You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.
Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

Example 1:
Input: n = 5
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: n = 8
Output: 3

class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        long left = 0, right = n;
        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            long coins = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;
            if (coins == n) {
                return (int)mid;
            } else if (coins < n) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return (int)right;
    }
}
