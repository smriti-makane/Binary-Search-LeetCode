367. Valid Perfect Square
Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.
A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.

Example 1:
Input: num = 16
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: num = 14
Output: false

class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        long start = 0; 
        long end = num; 
        while(start<=end){
            long mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            long mid_square = mid * mid;
            if(mid_square==num){
                return true;
            }
            else if(mid_square<num){
                start = mid+1; 
            }
            else{
                end = mid-1; 
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
